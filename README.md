Free Code Camp CCS/HTML Responsive Web Design Project #1

I really enjoyed this project, because I learned about containers, in particular display:flex and its functionality. I also learned how to make an image responsive to its parent element, which is essential so that the size of the image is appropriate should the screen or resolution change in dimension. Lastly, I struggled a bit with unorderd list in terms of reponsiveness, but revisited my notes and figured out that @media is a very useful tool when it comes to respnosiveness.
